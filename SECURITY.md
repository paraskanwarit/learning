## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Creating a public issue could expose the vulnerability to malicious actors.

### 2. **DO** report privately
Send an email to our security team at: `security@your-org.com`

### 3. Include the following information
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact if exploited
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested fix**: If you have one (optional)

### 4. Response timeline
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: As quickly as possible, typically within 30 days

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep actions updated**: Always use the latest stable version
2. **Review permissions**: Only grant necessary permissions to workflows
3. **Monitor logs**: Regularly review GitHub Actions logs for suspicious activity
4. **Use secrets**: Store sensitive data in GitHub Secrets, never in code
5. **Validate inputs**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs

### For Contributors
1. **Security review**: All code changes require security review
2. **Dependency scanning**: Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities
3. **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize external inputs
4. **Secret management**: Never commit secrets or sensitive data
5. **Access control**: Follow principle of least privilege

## Security Features

### Authentication

- **Content filtering**: Output is filtered for sensitive information
- **Access logging**: All access attempts are logged

### Network Security
- **HTTPS only**: All external communications use HTTPS
- **Certificate validation**: Proper SSL/TLS certificate validation
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Compliance

### Standards
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security controls and monitoring
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
